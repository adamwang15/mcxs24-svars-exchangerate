    "text": "Introduction\n\nMotivate your objective and research question by explaining why it is important to investigate this problem in one brief paragraph.\n\nHow monetary policy shocks affect exchange rate? The most well-known study from Dornbusch’s (1976) documented the overshooting model, which predicts that the monetary expansion would leads to an increase in domestic interest rate and persistene deprecision of exchange rate. However, more economists such as Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) utilized VAR model found that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to an appreciation in exchange rate, but might be delayed.\nThe recent study Kim and LimKim and Lim (2018a) further explored that relatively short delay in the effect of contractionary monetary shock to exchange rate appreciation for the UK, Australia, Sweden and Canada.\nThis paper aims to focus on investigate the effect of monetary shock in a small open economy Australia, applying the Bayesian Structural Vector Auto-regression (SVAR) model. What is the role of monetary policy shock in exchange rate behavior in Australia? Are the effect similar to those large countries? Do we find similar puzzling responses?"

The data are collected from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), adjusted in quarterly frequency and from 1980 Q1 to 2022 Q4, including 172 observations.\nThe first variable is the key variable in the analysis of the research, and the other 5 variables are the key monetary variables to identify the monetary shocks in Australia. All variables data have taken Logarithm except short-term interest rate and plotted in combined plots.\nTime-series descriptions:\nExchange rate changes are volatile overtime, exhibits peaks and troughs. Monetary base, GDP and CPI all illustrate increasing trend overtime, with some drops during the global financial crisis and during COVID-19 period. Short-term interest rate displays a downward trend since 2000. All time-series plots are restricted in the time period from 1980 Q1 to 2022 Q4.\nsummary statistics provides statistics summary of all variables from 1980 Q1 to 2022 Q4."
